# Best Fits
Note: All the major components for my projet can be found in the **docs folder** and the homepage for my website can be accessed through the **index.html file**.

## About the Website
For my project, I decided to create a fashion website. The look of it is similar to that of fashion blogs and clothing sites, and includes highlights of my favorite shoes and outfit combinations. I decided to take this route because fashion is a major means through which I express myself, but before this, I hadn't really taken the time to document my outfits and collection. The main function I wanted for my website was not only to showcase my wardrobe, but to also give users links to follow if they want to obtain one of the pieces themseles (and while I used direct links for some pieces, others were just attributed to the store I got them from to at least give them some direction).

## Creative Process
When it came to the planning stage for my site, I spent a lot of time looking through Pinterest for inspiration on how to structure it. I knew how I wanted to arrange the clothes for the photos (something I also gotten inspiration from with my own Pinterest boards), but after scrolling through the website ideas they had I stumbled across a few that I really liked ([Example 1](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/9218374232126216/), [Example 2](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/808818414359924402/)). Now using these ones as inspiration was incredibly ambitious, especially since I had never worked with HTML and CSS before this, but nonetheless I was hoping to achieve a design that mirrored those ones to some extent. 

For the first few weeks, a majority of my time was spent strictly focusing on the Kevin Powell tutorial. As I completed it in its entirety, I also worked to figure out which shoes and outfits I wanted to include, and took to taking pictures of them in a way that best fit. I took the time to edit all the pictures to give them a transparent background, because I knew that would help give the site a more sophisticated and cohesive look. After finishing the Kevin Powell tutorial, I mostly used a skeleton similar to his HTML and CSS to make the initial homepage for my site. With such, the early stages of my site looked like this:

When it came to preparing my full draft, I had a lot more work to do. I consulted with a lot of YouTube tutorials to help me, starting with one from [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRda7UtuhA&list=WL&index=13&t=896s). This tutorial was fundamental for helping me make my homepage, especially in terms of the background image in the header and hover effect in the navbar. I also used this tutorial for the Seasonal Styles page where I encorporated a layer and hover effect over the links and images to the season subpages, and to help me arrange the images of the shoes and the outfits. For the sneaker gallery on the homepage, I used a tutorial from [CodingNepal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsNaoDhzQm0&list=WL&index=20&t=485s) to make the gallery, and a different one from [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXyRa7jwk4&list=WL&index=22) to make it more dynamic and change colors. Composing the additional pages, along with editing little things like links, padding, and texts, was more simple using what I learned from Kevin Powell. This was what my full draft homepage looked like:

For my final draft, I had only a few little touchups I had to do. I fixed some more sizing and spacing issues, along with changed my text fonts and colors. As a finished product here is the official homepage for my site:

## Generative Contraints
### Baseline Criteria
✅Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
- For every page, the title was made using h1 to make it stand out and bigger than the rest of the text. H2 was used on the homepage to differentiate the different navigable pages within the website, and h3 was used solely on the Seasonal Styles page to divide up the different seasons. All pages also used used paragraph text for captions/descriptions. Color was also utilized to draw more attention to certain text, along with drawing correlation to certain elements. For instance, the box on the mainpage for winter is blue, with that same blue marking the header of the Winter page and the hover color for the links.  

✅Include at least 3 navigable html locations (separate pages or distinct scrolling locations on the same page)

✅Include a sitewide CSS stylesheet (i.e. an organized visual theme)

✅Link internally from all pages (no dead ends)

✅Include at least one licensed or fair-use image, with alt text

✅Credit all assets correctly on the site itself (or link to credits in the repo), including Title, Author, Source, and License

✅Successfully load all elements in a web browser, at least locally (i.e. file paths should work on any computer)

✅Use meaningful commit messages that say what’s changing (or even why)



### Aspirational Inspirations
**Dynamism**

✅Use responsive design (e.g. @media queries, flex-wrap, auto-fill, etc) to dynamically resize elements based on viewport width

✅Animate HTML elements via CSS or JavaScript (e.g. image carousel, @keyframes, :hover / :focus events, etc)
- [Gallery]
- [Navigation Hover]
- [Seasons Hover]

**Coding**

✅Use Flexbox or Grid layouts

✅Use classes shared across multiple elements to minimze repetition in your CSS

✅Add comments, whitespace, and other formatting to code to make it more readable

**Audience Engagement**

✅Use non-default fonts, drawing on visual unit knowledge

✅Use best practices for accessible design (see W3's Four Principles and the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool)
