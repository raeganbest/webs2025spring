# Best Fits

## About the Website
For my project, I decided to create a fashion website. The look of it is similar to that of fashion blogs and clothing sites, and includes highlights of my favorite shoes and outfit combinations. I decided to take this route because fashion is a major means through which I express myself, but before this, I hadn't really taken the time to document my outfits and collection. Thus, I took advantage of this assignment to do so. 

## Creative Process
When it came to the planning stage for my site, I spent a lot of time looking through Pinterest for inspiration on how to structure it. I knew how I wanted to arrange the clothes for the photos (something I also gotten inspiration from with my own Pinterest boards), but after scrolling through the website ideas they had I stumbled across a few that I really liked ([Example 1](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/9218374232126216/), [Example 2](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/808818414359924402/)). Now using these ones as inspiration was incredibly ambitious, especially since I had never worked with HTML and CSS before this, but nonetheless I was hoping to achieve a design that mirrored those ones to some extent. 

For the first few weeks, a majority of my time was spent strictly focusing on the Kevin Powell tutorial. As I completed it in its entirety, I also worked to figure out which shoes and outfits I wanted to include, and took to taking pictures of them in a way that best fit. I took the time to edit all the pictures to give them a transparent background, because I knew that would help give the site a more sophisticated and cohesive look. After finishing the Kevin Powell tutorial, I mostly used a skeleton similar to his HTML and CSS to make the initial homepage for my site. With such, the early stages of my site looked like this:
